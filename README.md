## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

I Learned and Gain Experience about Css Media Query and Css Flexbox. And this concept helped me in this Project.

In this project, I used media queries to make my website responsive. By adjusting the
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
  .title {
    font-size: 15px;
  }
}
```

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In Future, I want to learn about CSS Grid and try to be master in Css Flex-box Concept.
